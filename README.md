# DiabetesPredictionML

[![CCDS Project template](https://img.shields.io/badge/CCDS-Project%20template-328F97?logo=cookiecutter)](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/)

A simple FastAPI application that predicts diabetes risk using logistic regression based on clinical data features.

## What This Project Does

This project provides a machine learning microservice built with FastAPI that predicts the likelihood of diabetes from patient health data. The model is trained on a selected subset of features from a diabetes dataset, and the API exposes an endpoint to get predictions for new input data.

The project follows 12-Factor App principles, includes Docker support, automated testing, CI/CD workflows, and detailed documentation generated by MkDocs.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: Logistic regression classifier trained on clinical features
- **REST API**: FastAPI endpoints for model predictions
- **Docker Support**: Containerization for consistent deployment
- **Automated Testing**: Unit and integration tests
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs with MkDocs

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sudipX0/diabetes-prediction-ml.git
cd diabetes-prediction-ml

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the API

```bash
# Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Visit http://localhost:8000/docs to access the Swagger UI documentation.

### Using Docker

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t diabetes-prediction-ml .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8000:8000 diabetes-prediction-ml
```
## API Documentation

The API provides the following endpoints:

- `POST /predict`: Predict diabetes risk for input data

Example request to the prediction endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "pregnancies": 0,
           "glucose": 148,
           "bmi": 32.1,
           "diabetes_pedigree_function": 0.627,
           "age": 50
         }'

```
